# Get_latitude_longitude_based_on_address
Using Google API, I've created this python script to get Latitude and Longitude which is needed for one of the process at work

To use it all you have to do is to follow the 3 steps:
1. Enter the locations within the input file
2. Run the program
3. Extract the list from the output file
